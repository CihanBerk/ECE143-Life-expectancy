clean_data.py class does cleaning and structuring on the dataset of our project, named "Life Expectancy Data.csv." It was developed in Spyder, so if there are any module problems etc. please tell me.

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/home

The main function that calls clean_data() should be on the same folder with "Life Expectancy Data.csv" (There is an assertion for this.)

To get .csv output from the class, create_csvs() function should be called. This will create an "./output" directory and generate corresponding csv files in there. Output directory should be erased each time create_csvs() is called (there is an assertion for this.)

Please tell me any questions/problems about the code. As far as I checked, the output is as expected.
