# ECE143-Life-expectancy

Information about the aim and methods of our project can be found on "Group 5 Proposal.docx".

The main.ipynb file contains the main our project, which will show the work we have done. It will also be an example on how to use the classes we implemented.

The modules/classes we created for the project are all stored under the /Project directory. Each subfolder in /Project has its own readme, written by the original author(s) of the code.
